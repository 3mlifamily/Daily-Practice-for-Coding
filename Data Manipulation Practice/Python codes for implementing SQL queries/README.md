# Python codes for implementing SQL queries

This is the practice for rewriting SQL queries in Python using packages `pandas` and `numpy`.

Here is the blog explaining this implementation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

For this practice, `pandas`, `numpy` and `sqlite3` packages are required.

#### Install packages

Personally, I recommend to use anaconda which is easy to manage the packages.
* [anaconda free download link](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section)

After installing anaconda, you can easily install python packages in terminal. 
```
conda install package_name
```
### General Guide
First, you can run the codes in "DataBase query" to create the database.

The "database_relationship" picture can show the relationship between different databases.

After creating the database, you can run the codes in "Python code for SQL queries" to practice implementing SQL queries in Python.
