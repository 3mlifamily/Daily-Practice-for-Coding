# Pandas & Numpy practice

These are my practice on `pandas` and `numpy` packages, which are both very important packages when it comes to data manipulation and data analysis.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

For this practice, `pandas`, `numpy` packages are required.

#### Install packages

Personally, I recommend to use anaconda which is easy to manage the packages.
* [anaconda free download link](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section)

After installing anaconda, you can easily install python packages in terminal. 
```
conda install package_name
```
