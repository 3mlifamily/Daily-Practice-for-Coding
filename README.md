# Daily Practice for Coding

This is a record of all my coding practice including Data Manipulation, Data Structure and Algorithm, Data Visualization.

This is a list of all the practice:
* [Data Manipulation](https://github.com/lush9516/Daily-Practice-for-Coding/tree/master/Data%20Manipulation%20Practice)
* [Data Structure and Algorithm](https://github.com/lush9516/Daily-Practice-for-Coding/tree/master/LeetCode_Algorithm%20and%20Data%20Structure)
* [Data Visualization](https://github.com/lush9516/Daily-Practice-for-Coding/tree/master/Data%20Visualization) 

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

For Data Manipulation, `pandas` and `numpy` packages are required.

For Data Visualization, `matplotlib.pyplot` and `seaborn` packages are required.

#### Install packages

Personally, I recommend to use anaconda which is easy to manage the packages.
* [anaconda free download link](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section)

After installing anaconda, you can easily install python packages in terminal. 
```
conda install package_name
```

#### Load packages
```
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyploy as plt
import seaborn
```
